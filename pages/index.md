## Welcome to SC2Aiur, the Protoss content aggregator website!

#### Head on over to [our list of current content](/posts/) to skip the rationale and start learning Protoss :)

The website arose out of a perceived lack of a common knowledge base for Protoss players.
Terrans have [TerranCraft](https://terrancraft.com/) and Zergs have
[sc2swarm.com](sc2swarm.com); it was *hell, about time* for us alien bois to
get a place of our own besides the [ATP
sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/allthingsprotoss/), maintained since 2012 by heroic moderators.
It grew out of and for the allthingsprotoss community on reddit *(which is AMAZING and you should TOTALLY VISIT)*

The website is obviously mostly a work in progress; the whole idea is that we
get together and work on this collaboratively: everyone with a [GitHub (free)
account](https://github.com/) can submit guides, videos, notes, as small
Markdown snippets, [with a template and tutorial note
here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/src/CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md).
Maintainers filter out troll entries and
merge the content if it's trustworthy and noncontroversial. Controversial stuff
can **and should** be discussed on Reddit or Discord before merging.

Ideally, this will become something we can link to Protoss newbies and say,
*yeah, it's good stuff, we've vetted it and it makes sense - follow these and
you'll get diamond in no time*. If it does, it'll be because we, as a community,
made it so.

## How You Can Help

> *Ask not what Aiur can do for you...* etc, etc.

We're currenlty in need of

1. Content! For starters, I've added a few guides I've recently used and some
   stuff from the ATP sidebar. However, every time you come across something
   worth recommending, submit it
   [here](https://github.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/new/src/posts), from
   [this
   template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/src/CONTENT_TEMPLATE.md),
   or post a link to it [in the GitHub issues](https://github.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)!
2. Maintainers! This would mean joining the [GitHub SC2Aiur
   org](https://github.com/sc2aiur) and taking some time to
   occasionally review submitted content whenever that pops up. Reach out on
   Discord or through the aforementioned GitHub issues if you're interested.
3. Feedback! It's obviously a very early prototype and I'm still tinkering with it.
   Please report any issues or suggestions you may have on
   [GitHub](https://github.com/sc2aiur/sc2aiur.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc),
   Discord or Reddit. I'm sure there's a lot of bugs to be fixed; pointing them out is the fastest way to get that done.
    * a sidebar is on its way once I figure out how to set it up.
    * help with fixing these issues, as with all open source, is obviously most welcome!

*For Aiur!*
